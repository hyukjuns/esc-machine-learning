# machine-learning

* KNN is using Iris data set.

* KNN + SIMD, kNN + SIMD + Pthread is using bigger data set than Iris.

* K-means clustering is using Iris data set.

* Backprogapation Neural Network is made by Pseudocord in C language.

* Neural networks(Java) are feedforward networks using learned weights. The learned weights are created by the backpropagation algorithm of Matlab nprtool.
